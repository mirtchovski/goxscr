A rewrite in Go of the Plan 9 port of some of the xscreensaver hacks
(mostly the ones not using OpenGL).

For xscreensaver hacks go here: http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/

For the Plan 9 ports of the above go here: http://mirtchovski.com/p9/xscr/

Each hack is compiled into a separate binary. Sample:

$ make
...
$ ./moire
